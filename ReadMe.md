**NextCircle**

This is a small game, the developing platform is windows, the aiming platforms are webgl and android os.

## Idea
The original idea is not from me, this game is more like a clone. 

Want to know more, please see the below refences link.

## How To Play
Just point the newest circle.

## RoadMap

I heard some feeback from one of my friend.

- use more shapes, not only circle
- start game since with not one circle maybe 4 or 5 to add difficulty

And I got some idea too
- how about use "Zhao" as the shape, you know "How dare you name yourself Zhao" in one of Luxun's article, but maybe this is a little nude to my friend, I am thinking of it.

I got a little busy now, so maybe I have to delay this project.
